// ── SiteManifest wire contract (GET /api/bootstrap) ───────────────────────────
//
//  The atomic boot payload the geostat runner fetches ONCE to hydrate the whole
//  site (Grafana bootData / Retool fetchAppManifest pattern). Produced by the api
//  (apps/api/src/routes/bootstrap), consumed by the runner (apps/geostat/src/data/
//  site-manifest.ts). BOTH sides previously re-declared this shape because the api
//  cannot import `@statdash/react`. This is the shared home.
//
//  LAYERING of the fields (why some are precise, some opaque):
//    - Backend/engine-owned JSON DTOs (datasources) are JSON-serializable and
//      tenant-agnostic, so they are typed precisely here. They are STRUCTURALLY
//      identical to engine's DatasourceInstanceConfig (the engine remains
//      their semantic owner; this is the wire mirror, kept assignable both ways so
//      the engine type and the contract interoperate without a cast).
//    - React/renderer-owned blobs (pages, nav, chrome, chromeConfig, i18n) have their
//      INNER shape owned by the renderer (NodePageConfig, NavEntry, ChromeConfig…).
//      The backend is a pass-through projection and must NOT become a second source
//      of truth for the config schema, so those are opaque JSON here. The runner
//      refines them to its precise types via `SiteManifest = SiteManifestContract & {…}`.
